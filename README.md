#  Festival
Festival is an application built for macOS only.
It is heavily inspired by Partytime, another app with the same purpose,
the reason why I created a similar app is because Partytime is closed source.
And I wanted to see how the app worked under the hood but there was no way for
me to do so (except disassemble it).

This sparked the Festivalapp project, my goal
was the create an similar app that would have the same purpose but with my own touch
to it, the only thing that this app differs from Partytime is the fact that Festival is open source.

This app also offers a status bar which is able to display the current status, some of them includes
* Unkown contact
* Not a number
* Amount of messages delivered
* Not a contact
* Permissions success
* Permissions required
* etc
